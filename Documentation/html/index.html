<center><h1>Welcome to Simple Socks!</h1></center>
Simple Socks is a very basic wrapper for Winsock 2.2.<br>
The goal of this library is to provide an easy-to-use interface for basic socket operations.<p>
Simple Socks is intended to help C++ programmers not familiar with socket programming to jump in and get some hands-on experience using sockets.
You're encouraged to browse through the library's source code and see how the different functionalities are implemented internally.
There's some light commenting in the library source, and if there's anything in there that you don't understand please feel free to ask via GitHub comments.<p>
PRs and comments are welcome as well.<br>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/">Beej's Guide to Network Programming</a> - Brian "Beej Jorgensen" Hall</b> - A humorous and well-written guide to the BSD socket library, which is very similar to Winsock. Covers (I think) every aspect of using the socket library with easy-to-grasp illustrations that lead into thorough explanations. A great guide to read if you're interested in network programming and want to know about the capabilities available in BSD/Winsock. (If you're a Windows developer I suggest you ignore his advice about Windows and just read through what he has to say from section 2 onwards, then look through the Simple Socks source to see what's different. (very little))
</ul>
[Advanced]
<ul>
<li><b>TCP/IP Illustrated: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCP-Illustrated-Protocols-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321336313/">Volume 1</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCP-IP-Illustrated-Implementation-Vol/dp/020163354X/">Volume 2</a> - Gary R. Wright &amp; W. Richard Stevens</b> - A comprehensive, bit-level guide exploring every facet of the TCP/IP suite, from the hardware layer all the way up to the application layer. A little dated, but so is Winsock/BSD, and there's been fairly little change since then. A great read if you want to understand how networking technology actually works.  Volume 1 discusses the TCP/IP protocol suite specifications, Volume 2 discusses implementing the TCP/IP suite, and Volume 3 discusses high-level transactional protocols such as HTTP, NNTP and UNIX-Domain. Volumes 1 and 2 are a great resource if you want to know everything there is to know about TCP/IP. The third I can't really recommend. (It's well written, but the information contained therein is widely available for free online.)
</ul>
[Super Saiyan]
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc.html">The RFC Library</a> - Various Extremely Smart People</b> - If you get deep enough into networking then sooner or later you're going to hear about the RFC library. This is basically the 'notes' left behind by the people who created the internet as well as regularly updated information on new protocols, changes to old protocols, "rules" that your network applications should follow in order to work correctly and also the occasional bit of silliness slipped in between the cracks. There are only two downsides to the RFC library as a reference: Firstly it's enourmous; Secondly, it's mostly written in technobabble so complex as to be barely distinguishable from heavily accented Klingon street-slang. Nevertheless, once your brain has been sufficiently warped you will probably eventually find yourself gravitating to the RFC library to find the 'final word' on implementation details or other hard-to-find information. A must-have resource if you're doing something bizzare and arcane such as writing your own DNS resolver or etc. May the force be with you. (You're gonna need it.)
