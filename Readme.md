#Welcome to Simple Socks!

Simple Socks is a very basic wrapper for Winsock 2.2.
The goal of this library is to provide an easy-to-use interface for basic socket operations.

Simple Socks is intended to help C++ programmers not familiar with socket programming to jump in and get some hands-on experience using sockets. You're encouraged to browse through the library's source code and see how the different functionalities are implemented internally. There's some light commenting in the library source, and if there's anything in there that you don't understand please feel free to ask via GitHub.

PRs and comments are welcome as well.
